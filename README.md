# Auctionata demonstrator

Welcome to the Auctionata demonstrator, a coding challenge I was tasked with
by Auctionata.

The demonstrator is located in the ```app``` directory. There you will find
information about how to install and run the application locally for development.
There is also a link to a live demo hosted on Heroku.

API documentation is in the ```docs``` directory.
